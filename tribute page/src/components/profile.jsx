            Narendra Modi, born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, Gujarat, is
            the current Prime Minister of India. He has been in office since May
            26, 201412. Before becoming Prime Minister, he served as the Chief
            Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 201412. Modi’s early life was
            marked by humble beginnings. He helped his father sell tea at a
            railway station and later ran a tea stall with his brother2. He
            joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) at a young age, which
            significantly influenced his political career2. Modi holds a
            Bachelor’s degree from Delhi University and a Master’s degree in
            Political Science from Gujarat University2. His tenure as Chief
            Minister of Gujarat was noted for economic growth and development,
            but it was also marred by controversy, particularly the 2002 Gujarat
            riots2. As Prime Minister, Modi has launched several key
            initiatives, including the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India
            Mission), Make in India, and Digital India2

            A person familiar with the development said that around 15,000 people are expected to attend the gathering that will be “unique and different” in its format, flow and themes compared to past events that Modi has addressed in the US. “The main aim of the event is to celebrate the diaspora, their progress and future and ties with India.” Aware that the event is being planned in the middle of the American election season, in a departure from the past, organisers intend to keep it avowedly non-political. “There will be no elected officials invited for the event this time.”
